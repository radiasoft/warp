# This script optimizes the value of mgparam, the relaxation
# parameter used in the multigrid field solver.  It begins its search with the
# current value of mgparam and moves it initially in increments of .01.  The
# increment is reduced each iteration as the script narrows in on the optimized
# version.
#
# This may not be the most efficient search method, but it was fairly easy
# to write and it works.  It typically takes about ten iterations.
#
# For each iteration, the value of mgparam is printed and then the number
# of field solve iterations.  The last value printed is the optimized value
# and mgparam retains that value upon completion.
#
# An attempt is made to deal with the case where the maximum number of
# field solve iterations is reached.  The search is based of the value of the
# maximum error from the field solve after mgmaxiters iterations instead of the
# number of iterations.
#
# This script was tried for a number of different starting values of mgparam
# and it converged every time.  An effort was made to make the script robust
# and idiot proof.
