# EGUN_LIKE algorithm for calculating steady-state behavior in a ion source.
#
# Particles are injected on one time step only and the injection is
# turned off.  Those particles are then tracked through the system until
# there are no particles left.  On each time step, the charge density from
# the particles is accumulated in the array rho.  After all of the
# particles leave the system, the new field is calculated using the
# accumulated charge density.  Also, a selection of particles is saved
# each time step for plotting.
#
# At the end, the charge density is in the array rho, and the particle
# data is in the  particle arrays and ins and nps are set properly.
